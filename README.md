PassKey - MERN Stack Password Manager

Overview:
PassKey is a simple password manager built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This project is designed to manage and store user credentials for different websites securely. It features a minimalist frontend design with essential functionality for creating, editing, deleting, and viewing stored credentials.

Features:

Frontend:
Simple design with a form to input the site name, username, and password.
A table displaying all stored credentials fetched from the MongoDB database.
Ability to edit and delete credentials using dedicated buttons.

Backend:
CRUD operations using Express.js:
GET to fetch all stored credentials.
POST to add a new credential.
DELETE to remove a credential.
MongoDB database connection using a localhost instance.
Database name: Notehub.
Collection name: passwords.

Project Structure:
The project is organized into two main folders:

Frontend:
Contains the React.js code for the user interface.
Features a single form for input and a table to display the stored credentials.
Handles the edit and delete functionalities with simple buttons.

Backend:
Contains the Express.js server and API endpoints for database operations.
Connects to MongoDB using the mongoose library.
